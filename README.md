# Tree-Based-Methods-and-SMOTE-on-APS-Failure-Data
This project focuses on Tree-Based Methods and using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance in the **APS Failure dataset**. The dataset contains data from Scania trucks, where the goal is to classify failures in the Air Pressure System (APS) components.
